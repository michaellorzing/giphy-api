# giphy-api



The purpose of this application is to allow users to dynamically create buttons with search functionality for the GIPHY API. Each query from the search field produces a button that, upon interaction, produces a request that pulls 10 GIFs at a time and displays them to the page. The GIFs have built in dynamic functionality and animate and pause upon a click. 

In the future, I'd like to further improve the formatting and styling of the page. I'd also like to have the GIFs aggregate in a more uniform manner down the side of the page with better table and column formatting to add scroll functionality.
